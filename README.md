# Project1-Music-Analysis
Finding music trends from 2010 through 2019.



# Proposal:
Our project is to uncover trends in music by examining the properties of popular songs from the past decade.
 
 We examined relationships between valence, energy and danceability versus popularity, the overall changes of these properties over time, and the properties of the most popular genre versus other genres.
 
# Hypothesis:
Over a ten-year period, we thought the properties of music would reach a point of commonality where a specific energy, valence and danceability would ensure that the song would remain popular throughout the years.
 
 
 
# Definitions:
 
Energy: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.
 
Valence: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
 
Danceability: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
 
Popularity: The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.

 
# Conclusion:
From 2010 to 2019, the energy of popular music has been on the decline. Danceability did not have much variation but is possibly on the rise as of 2019. Valence, although having severe peaks and valleys, seems to be declining overall.
Compared to popularity, valence is evenly distributed, leading to no conclusive evidence that there is a direct impact on popularity.

Energy, however, has a significant concentration between 60 and 90 energy rating. Similarly, the danceability rating of the largest concentration of songs are ranked between 60 and 80 on the danceability scale.

Pop, being the most popular genre of music in our dataset, has had a greater influence on our conclusion than any other genre.

Throughout the decade, the valence of pop has had slight changes while the other genres have been through multiple significant increases and decreases. Pop energy has had a progressive decrease compared to the other genres, which have fluctuations throughout the years. Danceability in pop music has been relatively steady, but other genres have been on an increase after hitting a low apex mid-decade.
